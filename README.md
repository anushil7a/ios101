## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

YouTube: One of the platform's primary strengths is its ability to host extended videos, catering to diverse content requirements ranging from educational lectures to comprehensive documentaries. Moreover, its advanced algorithmic recommendations often align accurately with user preferences, ensuring a tailored viewing experience. 

Duolingo: My favored aspect of Duolingo is undeniably its gamified approach to language acquisition, seamlessly blending education with entertainment. Moreover, its capacity to adjust to individual learning rhythms and offer real-world contextual lessons, all without demanding exorbitant subscription costs, distinguishes it as an indispensable resource for language enthusiasts.

Nike Running App: My favored aspect of the running app is unequivocally its dynamic route generation, which tailors to users' desired distance and scenery. Additionally, its ability to provide real-time biomechanics feedback on stride and posture, all without imposing significant subscription fees, stands out as an invaluable feature for avid runners.
My app brainstorm:

app name: LifeMentor

Description: LifeMentor aims to bridge the gap between individuals seeking guidance in various aspects of their lives and experienced mentors across diverse domains. Unlike traditional coaching platforms, LifeMentor employs an AI-driven matching algorithm to ensure that mentees find mentors who align not just with their professional needs, but also with their personality and life values.

Features:

AI-Driven Matching: Uses data analytics and machine learning to match mentees with the most suitable mentors based on their goals, personality type, and preferences.
Interactive Calendar: Enables easy scheduling and rescheduling of sessions, ensuring both parties are always in sync.
In-App Communication: Offers text, voice, and video chat options, making interactions seamless.

Progress Tracking: Mentees can set goals and track their progress over time, with insights and reviews from their mentors.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
I encountered difficulties while attempting to utilize the "change" button to alter the background color in Xcode. The issue not only presented an error but also unexpectedly terminated my session on one occasion. However, after conducting thorough research and understanding the root cause of the problem, I was able to successfully implement the functionality, and the error was subsequently resolved.
